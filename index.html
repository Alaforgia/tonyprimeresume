        <p>
          I am a college graduate with 3 years of experience in behavioral
          health and 3 years of customer service experience. My experience
          working in behavioral health contributes to my ability to problem
          solve, being that things can be very unpredictable. All of my previous
          positions contribute to my capacity to work as a part of a team and to
          develop a teachable mindset. At Augsburg College, I majored in
          Exercise Science, which allowed me to combine my interests in health
          and fitness with my passion for helping others. As an eager and
          outgoing person, I enjoy client-facing services where I can directly
          engage with and improve people’s lives. My goal is to carry the same
          positive energy and communication skills to the health and wellness
          setting to increase employee satisfaction, productivity, and corporate
          profitability.
